# Computer Lab 1 (SDTSIA211)

This project is part of the SDTSIA211 course, where the focus is on the application of signal processing and statistical analysis techniques. The lab aims to implement and analyze key concepts from the course using Python, working with real-world data and applying both statistical methods and signal processing techniques to extract meaningful insights.

## Project Description

This lab project covers several key topics in signal processing and statistical analysis. The project is designed to apply theoretical knowledge to practical exercises, working with real-world datasets and signals. Techniques such as data filtering, signal transformation, and statistical inference are applied to analyze and extract patterns from the data.

## Project Structure

The repository contains the following key files and directories:

- **main.py**: The main script where signal processing and statistical techniques are implemented.
- **data/**: A directory containing datasets used for analysis.
- **analysis.py**: A module containing the core functions for processing signals and performing statistical analyses.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for exploring the data and running lab exercises interactively.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing the dependencies needed to run the project.
- **README.md**: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

To run the lab exercises and perform data analysis, follow these steps:

1. Load a dataset from the `data/` directory for analysis.
2. Run the main script to apply the signal processing and statistical techniques:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The output will display the results of the analysis, including visualizations and statistical summaries of the processed data.

### Key Steps in the Process

1. **Load Data**: Load real-world data from the `data/` directory.
2. **Process Signals**: Apply signal processing techniques such as filtering, Fourier Transform, or wavelet analysis.
3. **Statistical Analysis**: Perform statistical inference, hypothesis testing, or other analytical methods to extract insights from the data.
4. **Visualize Results**: Plot the results of the signal processing and statistical analyses to interpret the findings.

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to provide hands-on experience in applying signal processing and statistical methods to real-world datasets. The lab exercises reinforce theoretical knowledge by working through practical problems and analyzing the results.

## Technologies

- **Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebooks for interactive analysis and experimentation
